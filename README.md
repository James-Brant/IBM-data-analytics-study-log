# IBM-data-analytics-study-log
Study log for the IBM Data Analytics with Excel and R Professional Certificate

---

## Starting Point
I have no prior experience with coding, data tools, or analytics. I want to build strong foundational skills in:

- Excel for data analysis
- SQL for working with databases
- R for data visualization and analytics
- Data cleaning, interpretation, and communication

I will use this study log to stay organized and share my learning with future employers and mentors.
